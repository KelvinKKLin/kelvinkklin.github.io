    <h1 id="1-general-policy">1. General Policy</h1>
<p>Your privacy is important to me. It is my policy to respect your privacy regarding any information I may collect from you across my website, <a href="https://kelvinlin.com">https://kelvinlin.com</a>.</p>
<p>I only ask for personal information when we truly need it to provide a service to you. I collect it by fair and lawful means, with your knowledge and consent. I also let you know why I&rsquo;m collecting it and how it will be used.</p>
<p>I only retain collected information for as long as necessary to provide you with your requested service. What data I store, I’ll protect within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorised access, disclosure, copying, use or modification. However, while I make <u>best effort</u> to safeguard your data, I cannot guarentee that my website and associated will not be unlawfully breached by third-parties, and by continuing to use my website, you agree to hold me harmless to any damages that may occur as a result of such unauthorized breaches.</p>
<p>I don’t knowingly share any personally identifying information publicly or with third-parties, except when required to by law.</p>
<p>My website may link to external sites that are not operated by me. Please be aware that I have no control over the content and practices of these sites, and cannot accept responsibility or liability for their respective privacy policies.</p>
<p>You are free to refuse my request for your personal information, with the understanding that I may be unable to provide you with some of your desired services.</p>
<p>Your continued use of our website will be regarded as acceptance of my practices around privacy and personal information. If you have any questions about how I handle user data and personal information, feel free to contact me using one of the three options listed at <a href="https://kelvinlin.com/contact">https://kelvinlin.com/contact</a>.</p>
<p>This policy is effective as of 3 June 2019 and is subject to change at any time without notice.</p>
<p>I generated this section using the Basic option at <a href="https://getterms.io/">GetTerms.io</a>, and modified it to reflect the personal nature of my website (by using &ldquo;I&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;we&rdquo;).</p>
<h1 id="2-cookie-policy">2. Cookie Policy</h1>
<p>Cookies are used on my site to provide me with analytics information through the use of <a href="https://analytics.google.com/analytics/web/">Google Analytics</a>. I keep track of the number of visitors, the number of unique visitors, where my visitors are coming from, how long people stay on my site, and how they navigate through my site. You can learn more about how Google uses data when you use my website at <a href="www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>.</p>
<p>When configuring Google Analytics, I make <u>best effort</u> to anonymize the data that I collect, and to minimize the data I share with Google for their own internal services. I also make <u>best effort</u> to honour &ldquo;DO NOT TRACK&rdquo; requests; however, I cannot guarentee that all requests will be honoured as there are a diverse number of different standards that are used in industry. By default, the use of my website assumes consent to the use of cookies.</p>
<p>I use this information to help improve the layout and content of my website, and to determine visitor interest so that I can write to topics that people are interested in.</p>
<p><strong>If you do not consent to my use of cookies and/or my cookie policy, please stop using my website immediately.</strong> You can remove the cookies from your computer by clearing your browsing data from your internet browser. Please consult the documentation for your respective browser for further instructions.</p>
